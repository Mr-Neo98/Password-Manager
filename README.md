# Password Manager

## Overview

This Python-based password manager allows users to securely store and manage their passwords using encryption. The application uses a master password to derive an encryption key, which is then used to encrypt and decrypt stored credentials.

## Features

- Secure encryption of passwords using a master password.
- Add and view stored passwords.
- Automatically generates or retrieves encryption keys and salt.

## Requirements

- Python 3.X
- `cryptography` library

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/password-manager.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd password-manager
    ```

3. **Install the required library:**
    ```bash
    pip install cryptography
    ```

## Usage

1. **Initialize Encryption Keys:**
   - The script will automatically generate encryption keys and salt files if they do not exist.

2. **Add a New Password:**
   - Run the script and choose `add` to input and encrypt a new password.
     ```bash
     python password_manager.py
     ```
   - Follow the prompts to enter the source, username, and password.

3. **View Stored Passwords:**
   - Run the script and choose `view` to display stored passwords.
     ```bash
     python password_manager.py
     ```
   - Enter the master password when prompted to decrypt and view stored credentials.

## Code Explanation

- `derive_key(master_password: str, salt: bytes) -> bytes`: Derives an encryption key from the master password using PBKDF2.
- `load_key()`: Loads or generates the base encryption key.
- `get_salt()`: Loads or generates the salt used in the key derivation.
- `add()`: Encrypts and adds a new password entry.
- `view()`: Decrypts and displays stored passwords.

## Security

- **Master Password**: Required to access the encrypted passwords. The key derivation function (PBKDF2) ensures that the master password is securely hashed.
- **Encryption**: Passwords are encrypted using the Fernet symmetric encryption scheme.
